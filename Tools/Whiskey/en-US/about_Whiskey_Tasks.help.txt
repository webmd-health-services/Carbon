      whiskey.yml file by reading their values from an XML file.
    * `TaskDefaults`: sets default task properties.
    * `Version`: sets the version number for the current build.

    ## Common Task Properties

    Every Whiskey task has these properties:

    * `OnlyBy`/`ExceptBy`: controls if a task runs if the build was started 
      by a developer or a build server. By default, a task always runs. Valid
      values are `Developer` or `BuildServer`.
    * `OnlyDuring`/`ExceptDuring': controls if a task will run in the current
      run mode. Valid values are `Initialize`, `Build`, and `Clean`. Useful
      for having custom initialization tasks, cleaning tasks, etc. Make sure
      the task actually does work in the chosen mode. Some tasks don't have
      anything to clean or initialize, in which case these properties would 
      have no affect.
    * `OnlyOnBranch`/`ExceptOnBranch`: controls what branch a task should run
      on. By default, a task runs on every branch. When a build is run by a
      developer, there is no branch information, so tasks that have this 
      property will never run by a developer. Wildcards are supported.
    * `WorkingDirectory`: the directory in which the task should run. By 
      default, this is the directory of the whiskey.yml file.
