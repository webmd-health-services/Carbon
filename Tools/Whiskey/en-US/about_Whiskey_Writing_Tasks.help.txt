SHORT DESCRIPTION
    This help topic describes how to write your own Whiskey tasks.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    A Whiskey task is a PowerShell function that has:

    * the `Whiskey.Task` attribute
    * a `TaskContext` parameter
    * a `TaskParameter` parameter that's a hashtable
    * a `script` scope

    Tasks should be loaded into your build using the `LoadTask` task. 

    Here is a stub function to get you started:

        function script:FUNCTION_NAME
        {
            [Whiskey.Task('TASK_NAME')]
            [CmdletBinding()]
            param(
                [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
                [object]
                $TaskContext,

                [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
                [hashtable]
                $TaskParameter
            )

            Set-StrictMode -Version 'Latest'
        }


    To use your task in a whiskey.yml file, make sure the task is loaded first, then use the name from the `Whiskey.Task` attribute, e.g.

        Build:
        - LoadTask:
            Path: path\to\task\file.ps1
        - TASK_NAME:
            Property: Value
            Property2:
            - One
            - Two

    Everything under your task in the whiskey.yml file is passed to your function to the `$TaskParameter` hashtable parameter. For example, given the whiskey.yml above, your task would receive this hashtable:

        @{
            Property = 'Value';
            Property2 = @( 'One', 'Two' )
        }

    Whiskey supports these global task properties. They are *not* in the `TaskParameter` hashtable.

    * OnlyDuring
    * ExceptDuring
    * OnlyOnBranch
    * ExceptOnBranch
    * OnlyBy
    * ExceptBy
    * WorkingDirectory
    * IfExists
    * UnlessExists

    In other words, your task isn't allowed to have these properties.

    # Tools

    Whiskey can automatically install some tools for your task. The path to that tool is passed to your task in the `TaskParameter` parameter.

    To tell Whiskey what tools you depend on, add a `Whiskey.RequiresTool` attribute. It has two parameters: the name of the tool, and the name of the key to use in the `TaskParameter` hashtable where the path to your tool is saved.

    For example, given this task:

        function FUNCTION_NAME
        {
            [Whiskey.Task(''TASK_NAME'')]
            # The second parameter is the name of the key in the $TaskParamter hashtable where Whiskey should put the path to the Node executable it installs.
            [Whiskey.RequiresTool(''Node'',''NodePath'')]
            [CmdletBinding()]
            param(
                $TaskContext,

                [hashtable]
                $TaskParameter
            )

            $nodePath = Assert-WhiskeyNodePath -Path $TaskParameter[''NodePath''] -ErrorAction Stop
        }

    Whiskey will install the latest version of Node, and put the path to the Node executable in the `NodePath` key in the `TaskParameter` hasthable. You can see that the task is using `Assert-WhiskeyPath` to ensure the `NodePath` parameter points to an existing path.

    ## Installing a Specific Tool Version

    If your task requires a specific version of a tool, use the `Whiskey.RequiresTool` attribute's `Version` property:

        [Whiskey.RequiresTool('NodeModule::nsp', 'NspPath', Version='2.7.0')]

    If you want the user to be able to control what version of a tool to use, the `Whiskey.RequiresTool` attribute has a `VersionParameterName` property that should be set to a property name users can use in their whiskey.yml file to control what version of a tool to use. The default name is `Version`. For example, if your `Whiskey.RequiresTool` attribute looks like this:

         [Whiskey.RequiresTool('NodeModule::nsp', 'NspPath', VersionParameterName='NspVersion')]

    A user could use the `NspVersion` property to control what version of Node they want to use:

         Build:
         - TASK_NAME:
            NspVersion: 8.9.4

    In the example above, Whiskey would install version 8.9.4 of ths NSP node module.

    Whiskey supports installing:

    * Node
    * Node Modules
    * .NET Core SDK
    * PowerShell modules

    ## Node

    To install Node, add this to your task:

         [Whiskey.RequiresTool('Node','NodePath')]

    The `NodePath` string is the name of the key where the path to Node should be saved in the `TaskParameter` hashtable when calling your task.

    If the user doesn't use the version parameter to control what version of Node to use, Whiskey also looks in the user's package.json file at the `engines.node` property, e.g.

       {
            "engines": {
                "node": "^8.9.4"
            }
       }

    Node is installed to a `.node` directory in the build root. This gives every project its own version of Node to use.

    ## Node Modules

    To install a Node module, pass the name of the module (case-sensitive) to the `Whiskey.RequiresTool` attribute, prefixed with `NodeModule::`. For example,

        [Whiskey.Requirestool('NodeModule::nsp', 'NspPath')]

    would cause Whiskey to install the NSP module and send the path to its directory in the `NspPath` key of the `TaskParameter` hashtable when calling your task. The path will always be to the Node module's directory in the `node_modules` directory.

    Whiskey does not install these Node modules in your project's node_modules directory. It installs them to `.node\node_modules`, your project's dedicated "global" Node environment.

    ## .NET Core SDK

    To install the .NET Core SDK, add this to your task:

        [Whiskey.RequiresTool('DotNet','DotNetPath')]

    The `DotNetPath` string is the name of the key where the path to the `dotnet.exe` command should be saved in the `$TaskParameter` hashtable when calling your task.

    If the SDK version to install is not defined in the `whiskey.yml` file, then Whiskey will look for a .NET Core `global.json` file first in the task's working directory and then in the same directory as the `whiskey.yml` file. The `global.json` file defines the SDK version with the `sdk.version` property, e.g.

        {
            "sdk": {
                "version": "2.1.4"
            }
        }

    If no SDK version is found in the `whiskey.yml` or `global.json`, Whiskey will use the latest LTS release of the .NET Core SDK.

    Before installing the .NET Core SDK to the build root, Whiskey will first search for global .NET Core installs containing the desired version. If a global install is found with the correct version, that path is used and the install to the local build root is skipped.

    Whiskey will *always* update the `sdk.version` property within the `global.json` file found in the task working directory or the Whiskey build root with the version of the SDK that task is using. If a `global.json` file does not exist in either the working directory or build root, one is created in the build root.

    ## PowerShell Modules

    To install a PowerShell module, add this to your task:

        [Whiskey.RequiresTol('PowerShellModule::Whiskey','WhiskeyPath')]

    The `WhiskeyPath` string is the name of the key where the path to the module root should be saved in the `$TaskParameter` hashtable passed to your task.

    Use the `Import-WhiskeyPowerShellModule` function in your task to import the module. Pass the name (or names) of the module to the `Import-WhiskeyPowerShellModule` function's `Name` parameter.

    Modules are saved to a directory in working directory of the task that requires it. The exact directory is an implementation detail, and is subject to change. Use the path as passed to your task.
