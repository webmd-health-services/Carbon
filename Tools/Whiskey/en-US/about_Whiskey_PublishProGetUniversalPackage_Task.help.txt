SUMMARY
    Uploads a universal package to ProGet.

DESCRIPTION
    The `PublishProGetUniversalPackage` task uploads a universal package to ProGet. By default, it uploads all `*.upack` files in the `.output` directory. Pass paths to specific upack files to the `Path` property. It uses the `Publish-ProGetUniversalPackage` function from the `ProGetAutomation` module to upload the file. If a upack file is invalid, you'll get an error and nothing will upload.

    If uploading requires authentication, set the `CredentialID` property to the ID of the credential to use when uploading. Add the credential with the `Add-WhiskeyCredential` function.

    Set the `Uri` property to the base URI to ProGet. Set the `FeedName` property to the name of the universal feed to which you want to upload. By default, the upload will time out after 100 seconds. To change the default timeout, set the `Timeout` property to the number of seconds to wait before cancelling and timing out the upload.

    This task downloads and uses the [ProGetAutomation PowerShell module from the PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ProGetAutomation).


PROPERTIES

    * `Uri` (mandatory): the base URI to the instance of ProGet where the package should be uploaded.
    * `FeedName` (mandatory): the name of the universal feed in ProGet where the package should be uploaded.
    * `CredentialID`: if ProGet requires authentication when uploading universal packages, this should be the ID of the credential to use. Add credentials to your build with the `Add-WhiskeyCredential` function.
    * `Path`: the path to any upack files to upload. By default, all `*.upack` files in the `.output` directory are uploaded.
    * `Timeout`: the timeout, in seconds, to use when uploading the file. If the upload request takes longer than this, it will be cancelled and the build will fail.
    * `Overwrite`: replace/overwrite the package if it already exists in ProGet. The default behavior is to fail/stop if the package exists.
    * `AllowMissingPackage`: by default, if the paths in the `Path` property don't exist, the build will fail. To not fail the build when there are missing packages, set this property to `true`.
    * `Exclude`: Any paths to exclude from publishing. Wildcards are required. The exclusion is matched against the full path of each item from the `Path` property. If you don't care about the directory structure, each item should look like `*\filename.upack`.
    * `ProGetAutomationVersion`: the version of the ProGetAutomation PowerShell module to download and use. The default is the latest 0.4.* version.


EXAMPLES

    ## Example 1

        Publish:
        - PublishProGetUniversalPackage:
            Uri: https://proget.example.com
            FeedName: Apps

    Demonstrates the minimal configuration needed to upload a package. In this case, all `*.upack` files in the `.output` directory will be uploaded to `http://proget.example.com/upack/Apps`. No authenticaton will be used.

    ## Example 2

        - PublishProGetUniversalPackage:
            Uri: https://proget.example.com
            FeedName: Apps
            Path:
            - .output\App-*.upack
            CredentialID: proget.example.com
            Timeout: 600

    Demonstrates the full configuration available to upload a packae. In this example, only the `App-*.upack` file(s) will be uploaded to `http://proget.example.com/upack/Apps` using the credential with the `proget.example.com` ID. The upload will be allowed to take ten minutes, then will be cancelled.

    ## Example 3

        - PublishProGetUniversalPackage:
            Uri: https://proget.example.com
            FeedName: Apps
            Path:
            - .output\App-*.upack
            Exclude:
            - "*\App-Bad.upack"

    Demonstrates how to exclude a package from being published. In this case, any path that ends with "App-Bad.upack" will not be published. Exclusion items are matched against the full path of items from the `Path` property.
