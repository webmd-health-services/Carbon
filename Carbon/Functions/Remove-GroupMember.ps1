{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Removes users or groups from a *local* group.

    .DESCRIPTION
    You would think it's pretty easy and straight-forward to remove users/groups from a local group, but you would be wrong.  The quick solution is to use `net localgroup`, but that won't accept user/group names longer than 24 characters.  This means you have to use the .NET Directory Services APIs.  How do you reliably remove both users *and* groups?  What if those users are in a domain?  What if they're in another domain?  What about built-in users?  Fortunately, your brain hasn't exploded.

    So, this function removes users or groups from a *local* group.

    If the user or group is not a member, nothing happens.

    `Remove-CGroupMember` is new in Carbon 2.0.

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-CGroupMember -Name Administrators -Member EMPIRE\DarthVader,EMPIRE\EmperorPalpatine,REBELS\LSkywalker

    Removes Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine and Luke Skywalker from the local administrators group.

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-CGroupMember -Name TieFighters -Member NetworkService

    Removes the local NetworkService account from the local TieFighters group.
