    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets the file/SMB shares on the local computer.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Get-CFileShare` function uses WMI to get the file/SMB shares on the current/local computer. The returned objects are `Win32_Share` WMI objects.

    Use the `Name` paramter to get a specific file share by its name. If a share with the given name doesn't exist, an error is written and nothing is returned.

    The `Name` parameter supports wildcards. If you're using wildcards to find a share, and no shares are found, no error is written and nothing is returned.

    `Get-CFileShare` was added in Carbon 2.0.
