    .SYNOPSIS
    Returns a path's PowerShell provider.

    .DESCRIPTION
    When you want to do something with a path that depends on its provider, use this function.  The path doesn't have to exist.

    If you pass in a relative path, it is resolved relative to the current directory.  So make sure you're in the right place.

    .OUTPUTS
    System.Management.Automation.ProviderInfo.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-PathProvider -Path 'C:\Windows'

    Demonstrates how to get the path provider for an NTFS path.
