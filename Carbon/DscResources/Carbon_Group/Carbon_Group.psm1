    .SYNOPSIS
    DSC resource for configuring local Windows groups.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Carbon_Group` resource installs and uninstalls groups. It also adds members to existing groups.

    The group is installed when `Ensure` is set to `Present`. Members of the group are updated to match the `Members` property (i.e. members not listed in the `Members` property are removed from the group). If `Members` has no value, all members are removed. Because DSC resources run under the LCM which runs as `System`, local system accounts must have access to the directories where both new and existing member accounts can be found.

    The group is removed when `Ensure` is set to `Absent`. When removing a group, the `Members` property is ignored.

    The `Carbon_Group` resource was added in Carbon 2.1.0.
